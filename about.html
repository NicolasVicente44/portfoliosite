            <p>As a new software developer, I am constantly updating my toolkit and adding to my abilities. With a
                strong will to learn and ability to problem solve, new technologies and challenges are always
                welcomed
                by me!</p>

                Having had several past jobs in customer service and retail environments selling products people
                love, I have developed key soft skills:
            <ul>
                <li>Listening, finding out what people need and why </li>
                <li>
                    Communication, explaining technical things such as automotive and some financial concepts (I
                    worked in customer service/sales at a car dealership)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Professionalism, I know that as an employee to a company I represent that company and all of
                    their products and services
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reliability, with years of work under my belt since the age of 16 I learnt the value of showing
                    up and being dependable day in and day out
